# MiauOS-RW
09/01/2024
 Hey just thought I should add this here to keep people update as there is no code yet just so people don't think the project is dead already, no the project is not dead and since I've decided to build a bootloader for MiauOSRW I've been doing a lot of research into that and have also decided to make a UEFI based BIOS, all that's really left now is for me to  start refering to the UEFI Spec, and start programming. I do have other things going on at the moment so I don't know when that will be, but I am planning to start soon.
